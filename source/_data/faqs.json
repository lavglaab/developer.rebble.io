      {
        "question": "What are the Aplite, Basalt, Chalk, Diorite, Emery and Flint platforms?",
        "answer": "These are the platform names used to describe different generations of watches. For example, Aplite refers to the original Pebble and Pebble Steel. You can find a full list, as well as information about the capabilities of each platform, on the [Hardware Information page](/guides/tools-and-resources/hardware-information)"
      },
      {
        "question": "I cannot find the \"Developer Mode\" or \"Developer Connection\" toggle in the iOS or Android application",
        "answer": "Please make sure you have updated your mobile applications to at least 2.0. On iOS, you first need to enable Developer Mode in the global _Settings_ application on the phone. On Android, this can be enabled from the navigation drawer."
      },
      {
        "question": "`pebble` tool error: 'RuntimeError: Freetype library not found'",
        "answer": "Please install the freetype library on your computer: \n\n* Mac OS users can use the [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) packaging system and run `brew install freetype`.\n\n* Linux users should not have to do anything."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I save the state between app invocations, for example, if I want to store user selections etc and persist it across app invocations?",
        "answer": "Use the [Persistent Storage API](/guides/events-and-services/persistent-storage), or [PebbleKit JS](/guides/communication/using-pebblekit-js) `localStorage`."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate the total size of a dictionary?",
        "answer": "If you have a pointer to a `DictionaryIterator`, you can easily calculate the total size of this dictionary:\n\n```c\nint size = (int)received->end - (int)received->dictionary;\n```"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get realtime accelerometer data?",
        "answer": "Yes. See [this community blog post (external link)](http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/streaming-pebble-accelerometer-data/) for more information."

    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "App message error: 'The app rejected the update'",
        "answer": "This is likely caused by a mismatch between your watch application UUID and the UUID you registered for on the mobile application. Please make sure you use the same UUID on both ends."

  {
    "title": "Memory Management",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How apps are loaded for execution? For example, are apps always in RAM, or loaded in RAM one at a time when the user starts that specific app?",
        "answer": "Apps (code and static variables) are loaded entirely in RAM when they are started. Your resources are only loaded in RAM when you call `resource_load()` or one of the function that calls it (like `fonts_load_custom_font()` or `gbitmap_create_with_resource_id()`). Your app, and all memory it has allocated, will be removed from RAM when it is terminated."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the maximum code segment size? The data segment size?",
        "answer": "All segments share the same memory space. There is no limit on the segment sizes but the global limit of memory available to apps is currently around 24k bytes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a separate Read-Only data segment vs a Read-Write data?",
        "answer": "No. For apps, the data segment is all Read-Write."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can one app invoke another app to get around app size limits?",
        "answer": "You can use the PebbleKit iOS or Android to launch any application on Pebble."

    "title": "Pebble SDK 1.x Migration",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "In my old app `PBL_APP_INFO` I was setting the flags `APP_INFO_STANDARD_APP | APP_INFO_VISIBILITY_SHOWN_ON_COMMUNICATION`. How do I do that with the new `appinfo.json` file?",
        "answer": "You can add another flag to `package.json` under the `\"watchapp\"` block:\n\n```js\n\"watchapp\": {\n  \"watchface\": false\n  \"onlyShownOnCommunication\": true}\n```"
